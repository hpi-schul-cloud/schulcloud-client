## Requirements  
  
* node.js 12 or later

You might take a look at the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/hpi-schul-cloud/schulcloud-client/blob/master/Dockerfile) to see some more dependencies and latest version informations.

## Setup  
  
German docs on installing: [Setup SC](https://docs.hpi-schul-cloud.org/display/SCDOK/Setup)
  
Short version:

1. Clone directory into local folder  
2. Go into the cloned folder and enter `npm install`  
3. Install nodemon and gulp globally by entering `npm install -g nodemon gulp`  
  
## Run  
  
1. Start the [schul-cloud server](https://github.com/hpi-schul-cloud/schulcloud-server)  
2. Go into project folder
3. Run `gulp watch` to run gulp
4. Set the ENV-variable `TZ=Europe/Berlin` (for windows use `set TZ=Europe/Berlin`). You can also set the variables `SC_TITLE=HPI Schul-Cloud` and `SC_SHORT_TITLE=HPI Schul-Cloud` if you want.
5. run `npm run watch` to boot the application
6. go to `http://localhost:3100`

**Alternative with browser-sync**

1. run `gulp watch-reload` to run gulp with browser sync. It also starts the node-client-server.
2. go to `http://localhost:7000`
  
For connecting to the [SchulCloud Calendar-Service](https://github.com/hpi-schul-cloud/schulcloud-calendar) you have to set `export CALENDAR_SERVICE_ENABLED=true`.  
  
For connecting to the [SchulCloud Notification-Service](https://github.com/hpi-schul-cloud/node-notification-service) you have to set `export NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_ENABLED=true`.  
   
## Theming  
  
Add Themes to /theme directory. Call gulp and node with SC_THEME set to name of directory.  
then clear build files and gulp cache with `gulp clear`  
  
### Windows  
  run `set SC_THEME={themeName}` without spaces around the equal sign!

## How to name your branch and create a pull request (PR)
  
1. Take the Ticket Number from JIRA (ticketsystem.hpi-schul-cloud.org), e.g. SC-999  
2. Name the feature branch beginning with Ticket Number, all words separated by dash "-", e.g. `feature/SC-999-fantasy-problem`
3. Create a PR on branch develop containing the Ticket Number in PR title
4. Keep the `WIP` label as long as this PR is in development, complete PR checklist (is automatically added), keep or increase code test coverage, and pass all tests before you remove the `WIP` label. Reviewers will be added automatically. For more information check our Definition of Done [here](https://docs.schul-cloud.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=92831762).
